# LapTimer â€“ Subtraction Module

This repository will demonstrate my own contribution to the big team project called *LapTimer*. My task was to create a holistic system of subtracting two specific time values given after electrical impulse. Difficulties, their solutions and more detailed description of the whole project are provided below.
