# LapTimer – Subtraction Module

Team of 5 students.  
My role: digital circuit designer.  
Developed the subtraction module responsible for calculating the time difference between two stopwatch readings.

## Overview
- **Full project description:** [Overview](docs/overview.md)
- **Features:** BCD-based subtraction, carry/borrow correction, RC-delay capture, and 7-segment display output.
- **Technology:** Texas Instruments 74LS series logic (Full Adders, Flip-Flops, Inverters, XOR/AND/NOR gates).
- **Simulation & PCB:** Designed in [Multisim](schematic/multisim) and [Ultiboard](schematic/pcb) (with 3D projection).
