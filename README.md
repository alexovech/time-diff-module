# Time Difference Module
Digital time-difference calculator with PCB layout and simulation in Multisim 

# Purpose

Receives two lap-time values from independent stopwatches triggered whenever each object crosses the LDR sensor and calculates their difference. It handles carries, detects negative outcomes via the borrow flag, and drives the result to a seven-segment display. Eventually, the module gives an immediate and precise read-out of how far ahead or behind one object is.
